#          requests, or for backend resources (eg databases) being unavailable
#  report: hooks for custom reporting
#
#  Pipes here at the resource level will run before those defined at the storage
#  or migration level, otherwise pipes are run in the order they are defined.

# cache pipe Get via Cache.Get

#  plan for this resource. Only one storage plan may be the default, and a
